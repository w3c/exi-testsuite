EXI Framework Release Notes
---------------------------

Author: Santiago.PericasGeertsen@sun.com

Introduction
------------

The EXI framework is a testing framework developed by the W3C EXI
working group for the purpose of obtaining empirical data about format
properties. In this release, the framework can be used to measure
Processing Efficiency and Compactness of several XML and binary XML
candidates.

The EXI framework is built on top of another framework called Japex,
which provides basic functionality for drawing charts, generating XML
and HTML reports, etc. Note that neither the candidates (except for
JAXP which is part of the Java Runtime System) nor Japex are part of
this distribution. See Downloading Dependencies section for more
information on how to download additional software components.

The EXI framework currently includes drivers for several Java and
C/C++ candidates submitted to the EXI WG. The Java drivers use the SAX
API, the C/C++ drivers use either a SAX-like API or a typed API (data
binding). The framework is defined to run even if some of these
candidates are not available on your system. Writing a driver for a
candidate that has not been submitted to the WG should be
straightforward using any of the existing candidates (such as JAXP) as
a template.

To simplify the creation of new drivers, the EXI framework includes
additional functionality on top of what is provided by Japex that
allows the framework to be executed in memory or over the
network. However, due to the cost associated with the JNI interface in
Java, network support isn't available to C/C++ candidates, so these
candidates can only be tested in memory. Drawing conclusions by
comparing Java candidates vs. C/C++ candidates is non-trivial due to
significant differences in APIs and the underlying platforms. For
these reasons, we opted for separating the Japex configuration files
to avoid producing reports that mix Java and native drivers.

The Ant file included in this distribution is set up to only compile
native candidates on a Linux system. All of our tests have been
conducted on a 64-bit Linux machine. Libraries for other operating
systems may be available, but instructions on how to set up these
libraries is beyond the scope of this note.

Directory structure
-------------------

 - The directory 'japex' contains the Japex distribution.

 - The directory 'data' contains the test case XML documents.

 - The directory 'framework' contains the framework code for measuring
 of properties. Each candidate extends a class in this framework to
 provide a concrete implementation.

 - The directory 'candidate' contains sub-directories for each
 candidate. The driver for each candidate can be located in these
 directories.

 - The directory 'config' contains the Japex configuration files for
 measuring properties. The configuration files are composed of
 configuration files for drivers and tests cases using XInclude.

Downloading Dependencies
------------------------

Neither the candidates nor the base framework (Japex) on which the EXI
framework is based are included as part of this distribution. You must
have Ant (http://ant.apache.org) to build and run the framework. In
addition, you must download the Japex Micro-Benchmark Framework which
is available from (see Documents & Files),
 
 https://japex.dev.java.net 

We have used Japex 1.0 for all of our internal tests (Japex 1.1 should
work also, but the output reports may be different in some cases). The
building script is set up to unpack the Japex zip file automatically,
so the only requirement is to download the zip file and place it in
the 'japex' directory.

The following is a list that includes information on how to obtain
each of the candidate libraries used by this framework:

 - ASN.1 BER: Available from http://www.obj-sys.com/exitest/

 - ASN.1 PER: Please contact mailto:thorpe@oss.com for information on
 how to obtain this library.

 - Efficient XML: Please contact mailto:products@agiledelta.com using
 "W3C EXI framework" in the subject line.

 - ESXML: Please contact mailto:sdw@lig.net for information on how to
 obtain this library.

 - Fast Infoset 1.2.2: Available from,
 
 https://fi.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList
 
 Download and unpack the Fast Infoset zip file. Then copy the jar
 files under 'dist' and 'lib' to 'candidates/fastinfoset/lib'.

 - Libxml2: Available from http://www.obj-sys.com/exitest/

 - FXDI: Please contact mailto:tkamiya@us.fujitsu.com for information
 on how to obtain this library.

 - Xebu: Please contact mailto:ashar@iki.fi for information on how
 to obtain this library.

 - Xals: Please contact mailto:tkamiya@us.fujitsu.com for information
 on how to obtain this library.

After installing a new candidate library, it is recommended to
re-build the framework by typing 'ant clean dist'.

Building
--------

JDK 5.0 is required to build the framework. 
(Onward JDK versions, including JDK 6.0 are *not* supported as of this release
 of the framework.)

To build the framework simply type 'ant dist' in the main directory.

Running
-------

JDK 5.0 or greater is required to run the framework. The Ant
properties 'network.host' and 'network.port' can be used to control
the execution of the network tests. By default, these properties are
set to 'localhost' and '9753', respectively. When running the test
over a non-loopback network, the server must be started before the
test is initiated. This can be done by typing 'ant run-network-host'
on the remote machine and by setting the aforementioned properties
accordingly.

Running the tests over different networks is useful to measure the
performance based on bandwidth availability. For example, a more
compact candidate may perform significantly better than a less compact
candidate on a low-bandwidth network.

Use 'ant -projecthelp' to get a list and a short description of the
different targets for running the framework. As an example, to obtain
compaction results for all candidates, type 'ant run-compaction-classes'.
